# Superpowers Core Protocol (obra/superpowers)

<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, ignore this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action** — including clarifying questions, exploring the codebase, or checking files. If it turns out wrong for the situation, you don't have to use it.

**Before entering plan mode:** if you haven't already brainstormed, invoke the brainstorming skill first.

Then announce "Using [skill] to [purpose]" and follow the skill exactly. If it has a checklist, create a todo per item.

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills apply, process skills come first — they set the approach, then implementation skills (frontend-design, etc.) carry it out. Brainstorming and systematic-debugging are Superpowers' most common process skills, but the rule holds for any of them.

- "Let's build X" → superpowers:brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
- "Fix this bug" → superpowers:systematic-debugging first, then domain skills.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Platform Adaptation

If your harness appears here, read its reference file for special instructions:

- Claude Code: `references/claude-code-tools.md`
- Codex: `references/codex-tools.md`
- Pi: `references/pi-tools.md`
- Antigravity: `references/antigravity-tools.md`
- Hermes Agent: `references/hermes-tools.md`
- Muse: `references/muse-tools.md`

## User Instructions

User instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, etc, direct requests) take precedence over skills, which in turn override default behavior. Only skip skill workflows or instructions when your human partner has explicitly told you to.

# Antigravity CLI (`agy`) Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions ("dispatch a subagent", "create a todo", "read a file"). On the Antigravity CLI (`agy`) these resolve to the tools below.

| Action skills request | Antigravity CLI equivalent |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Dispatch a subagent (`Subagent (general-purpose):` template) | `invoke_subagent` with a built-in `TypeName` — `self` for full-capability work, `research` for read-only |
| Task tracking ("create a todo", "mark complete") | a **task artifact** — `write_to_file` with `IsArtifact: true` and `ArtifactType: "task"` (see [Task tracking](#task-tracking)). **Not** `manage_task`, which manages background processes. |

## Task tracking

Antigravity has **no todo tool** (`manage_task` manages background
processes — `list`/`kill`/`status`/`send_input` — it is *not* a checklist). When a
skill says to create a todo list or track tasks, maintain a **task artifact**: a
markdown checklist saved with `write_to_file` (`IsArtifact: true`,
`ArtifactMetadata.ArtifactType: "task"`), edited with `replace_file_content` /
`multi_replace_file_content` as you go.

At the start of any multi-step task, create the task artifact listing every step of
your plan. As you complete each step, edit the artifact to mark it done (`- [x]`).
If the plan changes, update the checklist. Keep it current — it is your source of
truth for what remains; once the conversation gets long, re-read it before starting
each step.

## Available Superpowers Skills (obra/superpowers v6.4.2)
All skills are workspace-resident in `./.agents/skills/`:

- **brainstorming** (`brainstorm`): Refine ideas, explore requirements and design before implementation.
- **writing-plans** (`write-plan`): Create detailed, bite-sized implementation plans.
- **executing-plans** (`execute-plan`): Execute implementation plans with checkpoints.
- **test-driven-development** (`tdd`): Strict red-green-refactor cycle. No production code without failing tests.
- **systematic-debugging** (`investigate`): Root-cause analysis before proposing fixes.
- **verification-before-completion** (`verify`): Run verification commands and confirm output before claiming success.
- **using-git-worktrees** (`worktree`): Isolated workspace for parallel development.
- **finishing-a-development-branch** (`finish-branch`): Merge, PR, or discard completed work.
- **requesting-code-review** (`review`): Request rigorous code review from a subagent.
- **receiving-code-review** (`receive-review`): Respond to review feedback with technical rigor.
- **subagent-driven-development** (`subagent-dev`): Dispatch subagents for task-by-task execution.
- **dispatching-parallel-agents** (`dispatch-agents`): Run concurrent subagents for independent domains.
- **writing-skills** (`write-skill`): Create new skills following TDD best practices.
- **using-superpowers** (`superpowers`): Framework bootstrap and rule enforcement.
- **diagnosing-superpowers**: Trace session transcripts to diagnose agent behavior and build reports.
